You must use pivot actions immediately after you used the Devise a Stratagem action. When you do so, you lose the result of the roll from Devise a Stratagem, unable to substitute it for a Strike later during your round, then use the ability described in the action. As a pivot action discards your Devise a Stratagem roll, and pivot actions need a Devise a Stratagem roll to be used, you can typically only use one pivot action per round. Pivot feats may also have a Turnabout line in their description. If the dice value of your discarded Devise a Stratagem roll was 15 or higher, you may choose to also follow the abilities written in that line."
